    <h2>Swedish Meatballs (Svenska Kottbullar)</h2>
    <p>
      This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We
      frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the
      effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown
      gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
      <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
      <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>⅓ pound finely ground pork</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
      <li>½ (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until
        crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook
        and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a
        mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper,
        nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix
        in bread crumbs and cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off
        about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place
        meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about
        5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink. Place browned
        meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes.
        Remove meatballs to a serving dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into
        drippings until smooth. Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total
        about 2 1/2 cups liquid. Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly,
        until thickened, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black
        pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.
      </li>
